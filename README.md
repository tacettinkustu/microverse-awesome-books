## Project Description

"Awesome books" is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list. By building this application, you will learn how to manage data using JavaScript. Thanks to that your website will be more interactive. You will also use a medium-fidelity wireframe to build the UI.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running usual steps. Because there is no framework or any other special way. There is only plain JS, HTML and CSS. So you can get a local copy and running it in a code editor.
